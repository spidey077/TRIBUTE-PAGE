                <li><span class="date">1930s:</span> Becomes a prominent figure in quantum mechanics and theoretical physics.</li>
                <li><span class="date">1942:</span> Appointed as the scientific director of the Manhattan Project, the U.S. government's secret project to develop the atomic bomb.</li>
                <li><span class="date">1943:</span> Moves to Los Alamos, New Mexico, to lead the laboratory where the bomb's development takes place.</li>
                <li><span class="date">July 16, 1945:</span> Oversees the first successful test of an atomic bomb, codenamed "Trinity," in the New Mexico desert.</li>
